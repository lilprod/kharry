                       The traveler (Kharrier) membership allows you to post travels or departures, that is, to post an itinerary inviting potential senders to entrust you with item(s) to deliver for them at your destination or during your itinerary in exchange for a contribution for luggage sharing and benefit from Kharry\'s pairing service. The traveler (Kharrier) membership is free. You can post a travel by using our website, both enabling you to benefit from the exposure to Kharry\'s community of luggage sharers and potential senders.<br>

                       The sender membership which is also free allows you to reserve and book a space in the traveler (Kharrier) luggage(s), in the available travels posted by the traveler (Kharrier) members for an amount asked by the kharrier. You can book a space by selecting the one that is more convenient for you.<br>

                       The receiver doesn’t require a membership. The receiver collects the item(s) from the traveler (Kharrier) at the destination.<br>

                       Payment to the Kharrier is processed once the receiver confirms the reception of the item(s).<br>

Once the space is booked, the traveler (Kharrier) will also be able to know the identity of the sender(s) by receiving an email notification. Email addresses and phone numbers are kept confidential unless explicitly requested by the member concerned.<br>

As a rule, the administrators inform travelers (kharriers) of cancellations by their senders. However, if the cancellation occurs outside of our opening hours, it is sometimes not possible for us to let the traveler (Kharrier) know before the departure time. In these cases, the collaboration of the senders who must cancel is encouraged.
